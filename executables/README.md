Here you can find executables for the gamne.

# Linux
To run it on Linux, you have to download the `gamne_linux` file, run `cd [download path]`, replacing `[download path]` with the download location of the file. Then, run `./gamne_linux`.

# Windows
TBA

# Other
Because I do not have any other OS's other than Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows, you will have to compile the gamne in your OS ~~or wait until my computer breaks and by chance get the default OS to be something other than Ubuntu or Windows~~.
