# Gamne
This is a gamne that I created in like a week

Also it's pronounced /geɪmʷə/ or /geɪmwə/ (geymwuh) because I kinda associate "mn" with /ŋ͡m/, which for me kinda sounds like /mw/

# Compiling
If you're on Linux, you can run this:
```
git clone https://github.com/MinersHavenM43/gamne.git gamne
cd gamne
make
./gamne
```
I likely is very similar on Windows too, but I'm not sure because I am currently writing this on Linux.
I might also add pre-compiled versions for both Linux and Windows.
