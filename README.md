# Gamne
This is a gamne that I created in like a week

Also it's pronounced /geɪmʷə/ or /geɪmwə/ (geymwuh) because I kinda associate "mn" with /ŋ͡m/, which for me kinda sounds like /mw/

It has a [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/qNH8GHk9EU), where you can discuss modding and suggestions for the gamne

## Gameplay

Currently, there is no gameplay. You can currently only walk around in sinefully-generated biomes, like the forest and the mountains.

# Compiling
If you're on Linux, you can run this:
```
git clone https://github.com/MinersHavenM43/gamne.git gamne
cd gamne
make
./gamne
```
I likely is very similar on Windows too, but I'm not sure because I am currently writing this on Linux.
